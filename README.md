### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python, Spark and Big Data!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Python
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Remote Work
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about LTE and IMS
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @RodolfoSeki (twitter)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: At some point of my life, I was sitting in a rented car, in a foreign contry, in a bar parking lot, debugging an application. Praying that no one would call the police on me. :sweat_smile:
